## Installation

#### Important: You **must** have node.js (tested on v16.13.1) installed on your machine. [Download here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### There are two ways of initializing this project after cloning it

- Method One (Recommended):

  - Windows: Run the `win-init.bat` script provided in the root directory of the project.
  - Linux/macOs: Run the `sh-init.sh` script provided in the root directory of the project.

- Method Two (Manual):

  - Step 1: Install dependencies

    Run the following commands at the root directory of the project.

    Install global dependencies (Concurrently)

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

    Install server dependencies

    ```sh
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

    Go back to main folder

    ```sh
    cd ..
    ```

    Install client dependencies

    ```sh
    cd client
    npm install
    ```

  - Step 2: Create database

    This app works with a mySQL database. You shall create a new local database and a user with admin rights over it. Otherwise, you can initiate a new mySQL cloud database and properly connect to it.

    Tables will be created automatically.

  - Step 3: Create a .env file

    1- Navigate to /server

    2- Create a .env empty file

    3- Fill in the file with the guidelines provided at the `.env-sample` file in the same directory. During this step, you'll use your local/cloud DB information.

## Usage

#### Important: You will first need to make sure your mySQL database is up and running.

After installation, you can do the following:
- Windows: Run the `win-init.sh` script provided in the root directory of the project.
- Linux/macOs: Run the `sh-start.sh` script provided in the root directory of the project.

Otherwise, run the following command on the root directory to start both server and client concurrently.

```sh
npm start
```

Server will start and listen on port 5000. Client will start on port 3000.

Folder creation is not supported yet. 

On the hosted app, default user is admin/admin. However, you can create one by simply setting your username and password.
